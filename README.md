# Basic Windows Background changer

## Change your windows background with a few words

Built using python because I felt the default way to change backgrounds was a little too slow.

### **Setting up for yourself**

1.  Download this project.
2.  Inside **bg.py**, change the **WALLPAPER_PATH** to whichever location you will store your images.
3.  I have mine set to work with just .png images, if you want to change it to other formats you can replace **".png"** on **line 11** with whatever image format you like.
4.  Inside of **bg.bat**, set the path to wherever you saved this project.
5.  Edit System Environment Variables, click PATH and add a new path for the folder your files are in.
